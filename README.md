# Android-App-User-List

Creating a comprehensive `README.md` is crucial for documenting your project, guiding new users, and providing a detailed overview for contributors. Below is a template tailored for a typical Android project using Jetpack Compose, Hilt for dependency injection, and other modern Android development practices. You should customize it to fit the specific details and features of your project.


## Features

List the key features of your app. For example:

- Modern UI with Jetpack Compose
- MVVM Architecture
- Dependency Injection with Hilt
- Networking with Retrofit and Coroutines
- Comprehensive Unit and UI Tests
